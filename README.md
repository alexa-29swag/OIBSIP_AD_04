QUIZ APP

I’ve been working on enhancing a quiz-based Android app that includes multiple difficulty levels — from Basic to Difficult — using structured JSON data.
While building out the Quiz section, I focused on improving the user experience by:
✅ Restricting users to one answer per question
✅ Providing immediate visual feedback with green/red highlights
✅ Disabling answer options post-selection to avoid multiple taps
✅ Auto-transitioning to the next question with a short delay
✅ A cleaner and reusable logic using a single click handler for all options
✅ Added an button that redirects pop-opens my LinkedIn page as the designated developer of the app

The core logic is written in Java with Android XML layouts, making it modular and easy to extend. The questions are dynamically loaded from a JSON file bundled within the app, allowing quick updates without changing the codebase.

👨‍💻 Tech Stack:
Java + Android SDK
XML UI components
JSON for data
Material Design (AlertDialogs, theme)
Handler() for controlled transitions

This kind of project gave me a better grasp on:
 🔹 Managing UI state efficiently
 🔹 Implementing better UX practices for quiz interfaces
 🔹 Writing reusable and maintainable logic for multiple views

Conclusion 📱:
An Quiz App that delivers the aspects of a good trivia with some smart UX logic backing it further.
